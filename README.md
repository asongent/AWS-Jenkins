Ok guys. I am gradually gaining experience in DevOps. I have been able to integrate Jenkins with some 
of Git repo. It was amazing guys. Although it wasn't for me to catch all the steps. You can imagine

Thank you all for every video you put out there for some of these lessons.

They were of great help to me
